Recursion is an essential concept in programming that allows us to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub problems.

Memoization is a technique used in programming to optimize the performance of recursive functions by caching or storing the results of expensive function calls and reusing them when the same inputs occur again. It is particularly useful when dealing with functions that exhibit repetitive and overlapping sub problems.

Implemented these concepts in Factorial and Fibonacci series during the session where we came to know about importance of those concepts in such type of repetitive calculations in problems to do in efficient way.

Stream API
The Stream API in Java provides a powerful and concise way to process collections of data. It allows you to perform operations on a sequence of elements, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing, in a declarative and functional style. It simplifies complex operations and enables parallel processing.
The Stream API enhances productivity and performance by offering a modern approach to working with collections in Java.
